# Stage 1: Compile and Build angular codebase

# Use official node image as the base image
FROM node:latest as build

# Set the working directory
WORKDIR /usr/local/app

# Add the source code to app
COPY ./ /usr/local/app/

# Install all the dependencies
RUN npm install

# Generate the build of the application
RUN npm run build


# Stage 2: Serve app with nginx server

# Use official nginx image as the base image
FROM nginx:latest

# Copy the build output to replace the default nginx contents.
COPY --from=build /usr/local/app/dist/coreui-free-angular-admin-template /usr/share/nginx/html

# Expose port 80
EXPOSE 80

The first stage uses the node image as the base image and installs all the dependencies and builds the application.

The second stage uses the official nginx image as the base image and copies the build output from the first stage and replaces the default nginx contents.

The final image will contain the built app and the nginx server to serve the app.

Step 3: Build the docker image
Run the following command to build the docker image.
        $docker build -t <username>/<imageName>:<tag> .
    Ex :$docker build -t edoojunaid/manzerfront:1.0 .

The above command will build the docker image and tag it with the name edoojunaid/manzerfront:1.0 .
The dot "." at the end of the command is important. It tells docker to look for the Dockerfile in the current directory.


Step 4: Run the docker container

docker run -d -p 4200:80 --name manzerlacazfront edoojunaid/manzerfront:1.0

The above command will run the docker container and expose port 80 of the container to port 4200 of the host machine.

Step 5: Access the app

Navigate to http://localhost:4200 to access the app.


To send the image to the docker server, run the following command.
    $docker save <imageName>:<tag>  | bzip2 | pv | \ssh <serverUser>@<serverIp> 'bunzip2 | docker load'
Ex : $docker save edoojunaid/manzerback:1.0 | bzip2 | pv | \ssh nadeem@192.168.31.83 'bunzip2 | docker load'
$docker save edoojunaid/manzerfront:3.0 | bzip2 | pv | \ssh nadeem@192.168.31.82 'bunzip2 | docker load'
